00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v John Smith>Good morning everyone, let's get started with our sprint planning.</v>

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Sarah Johnson>Thanks John. I wanted to discuss the login bug that's been reported by several users.</v>

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:20.000
<v John Smith>Yes, Sarah, can you take a look at that? It seems to be timing out after 30 seconds on the authentication endpoint.</v>

4
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:28.000
<v Sarah Johnson>Sure, I'll fix that by end of day. It's probably the token refresh mechanism.</v>

5
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.000
<v Mike Chen>I've been working on the API documentation. We need to update it for the new v2 endpoints.</v>

6
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.000
<v John Smith>Good point Mike. Can you handle that documentation update by next week?</v>

7
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Mike Chen>Yes, I'll have the API docs updated by Friday.</v>

8
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Sarah Johnson>Also, we should add the new user profile feature. That's been requested by the product team.</v>

9
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.000
<v John Smith>That sounds like a user story. Mike, can you write that up?</v>

10
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Mike Chen>Sure, I'll create the user story for the profile feature.</v>

11
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.000
<v John Smith>Great. Let's also make sure we deploy the hotfix today. Sarah, can you handle that?</v>

12
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Sarah Johnson>Yes, I'll deploy the hotfix after fixing the login bug.</v>

13
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.000
<v John Smith>Perfect. Any other items to discuss?</v>

14
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.000
<v Mike Chen>We should probably add some unit tests for the payment module. It's been causing issues.</v>

15
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.000
<v John Smith>Good catch. Mike, can you add those tests as a medium priority task?</v>

16
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.000
<v Mike Chen>Will do. I'll have those tests written by end of sprint.</v>

17
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.000
<v John Smith>Alright team, that wraps up our sprint planning. Thanks everyone!</v>
